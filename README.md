# OSCP
This repository contains scripts that I found, developed and/or tweaked as I studied for the OSCP. This is as much a central area for me to organize my materials as it is a place to help others studying for the OSCP.
I take no responsibility for any damage that may be caused to your system by trying these scripts. Nor do I guarantee that they will work or continue to work.
Never use these scripts on a system that you don't have permission to use it on.
Thanks and enjoy!
